        "**1. Introduction**\n",
        "LLMs, including BERT, continue to revolutionize the domain of NLP and, generally, natural language understanding. BERT, which is developed by Google, uses a transformer architecture for pre-training of deep bidirectional representations (Roccabruna et al., 2022). This means that it is able to the left and thereby improving its chances of comprehending complex contextual meanings from a word. The main focus of this task is to perform sentiment analysis on the movie review data taken from IMDb using the IMDb movie reviews dataset, in which the model should work as a BERT-based model to understand the content of the text and be able to classify its sentiment accurately.\n",

        "Prottasha et al., (2022) explored that the quantity of information provided by users through a variety of sources has increased as a result of the Internet connection (Nguyen et al., 2020). Therefore, it should come as no surprise that significant plurality in terms of life experiences and worldviews is advantageous for sentiment analysis. However, the primary problem facing the Bangla natural language processing (NLP) community, which include sentiment analysis, is the absence of labeled data (Geetha and Renuka, 2021). Deep learning methods such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText, which focus primarily on context-free word vectors, are used in much of the Bangla literature. All the same, these models provide every word its own distinct vector. NLP has dramatically improved in recent years, largely because to pre-trained language models like Bert.\n",
        "Nugroho et al., (2021) researched that the one of the key measures to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile apps is the feedback of their users (Pota et al., 2022). Owing to their high complexity levels, textual user evaluations pose large challenges for sentiment analysis because they are within the unstructured data (Li et al., 2021). Prior methods do not take care of contextual information, as found in the reviews. Furthermore, due to the small amount of data, the model gets overfit (Pota et al., 2020). More specifically, BERT is a novel approach to transfer learning that amplifies the negative impact of contextual representation (Qasim et al., 2022). This work adjusts two different pre-trained models to investigate the efficacy of fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis.\n"

        "This assignment affords an opportunity to use and fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment classification. The procedure consists of several crucial stages: The process consists of a few key steps:\n",
        "1.\tDataset Preparation: The IMDb dataset is used, which contains movie reviews and ratings. The data collection is suitable for this type of tokenization.\n",
        "2.\tTokenization: The task of tokenization is to take raw text and transform it into a form that the model is going to accept (Nguyen et al., 2020). Another preprocessing step practiced is the tokenizer, which is used to divide the text into tokens so they fit the input specification of the model.\n",
        "3.\tModel Configuration: It select a BERT model, known as a transformer that has previously undergone sequence classification training. This model is a good fit for the sentiment analysis problem because it has two possible output labels: positive and negative.\n",
        "4.\tTraining: The model is trained on eighty percent of the IMDb dataset, whereas validation is performed on the remaining twenty percent of the dataset. Hyper-parameters like learning rate, the number of batches or iterations, and epochs are set to achieve the best model.\n",
        "5.\tEvaluation: The last step in training the model is to analyze its performance on a data set that it has not previously encountered. It is often important to know how well the model generalizes to unseen data, and therefore such measures as accuracy and loss are used to determine this.\n"
